Black Hole Generator:
  description: |-
    An experimental singularity lab created by the Great Race. Commonly called the BHG.
    A drawing published by BHGO of the Black Hole Generator, according to detection and spying reports.
    This building has not been implemented in the iPhone client.
    Space Stations now have the ability to restrict BHG use within their jurisdiction once their parliament reaches level 23.
    The black hole generator is said to do a lot of crazy mind bending stuff. With the power of a singularity, it changes the universe by multiplying it with an alternate universe. Here are some evidence-supported features:
    When you try to start it you can select one of the options presented for what you want it to do; if it does not fail on startup your choice will happen. The options are listed below:
    Side Effects:
    Side Effects can occur anywhere within the zone and happen when the BHG succeeds and the side effect chance comes up.  Side effects are more random and can be beneficial.
    If a space station has enacted BHG Neutralization in it's controlled systems, side effects will not happen in those systems.
    More about moving planets: You can move into an orbit that your species normally can't inhabit, but all food producers will still produce as normal. However, you may find yourself at negative plots which does impact your happiness production.
    Failure Results:
    Failure effects tend to be non-beneficial.  For example; while a side effect can wind up adding a few plot sizes to a planet, a failure will always subtract plot sizes if that effect happens.
    Recipe:
    The glyphs must be assembled in the following order.
    Kerogen, Beryl, Anthracite, and Monazite
    Strategies:
    Glyphs from the spliting of 5 BHG plans in the Dillon Forge provided clues on the recipe:

Citadel of Knope:
  description: |-
    The Citadel of Knope has historically been very poorly understood. It seems now that a Citadel amplifies the defensive value of SAW buildings.
    It has been discovered that a Citadel will also repel debris from nearby planets destroyed by fissures. Damage from an imploding planet is calculated by these factors:
    Range, Citadel, if Gas Giant
    ((100 - range)/divide by 2 if target a GG) - (2 * Citadel level)
    What this means is that a Citadel of level 25 or greater on a gas Giant protects it completely.
    The Saben are known to keep these on their planets. They can also be found on random Diablotin planets.
    A Citadel of Knope plan can be built in the Archaeology Ministry by combining beryl, sulfur, monazite, and galena glyphs.

Crashed Ship Site:
  description: |-
    The Crashed Ship Site allows you to add 5% to each of the stats / bonuses of each of your newly built ships per level of the Crashed Ship Site. And it does this without any additional cost to your ships, by allowing you to harvest alien technology from the crashed ship.
    Stats increased are: Speed, Hold Size, Stealth, and Combat
    The Bonus is added (not multiplied) to all other bonuses and the sum of all bonuses is applied. For example: a level 3 crashed ship site (providing 15% to all ship related bonuses) combined with level 5 shipyard (provides 5% increase to ship speed) would result in a 20% increase to ship speed.
    You can build a Crashed Ship Site by merging monazite, trona, gold, and bauxite glyphs in the Archaeology Ministry.

Gas Giant Settlement Platform:
  description: |-
    The Gas Giant Settlement Platform allows settlement of a gas giant when this would otherwise not be possible. In order to upgrade platforms you'll need a good supply of structural minerals such as rutile, chromite, bauxite, magnetite, beryl, or goethite.
    The Gas Giant Settlement Platform is a permanent structure, which means that it remains even after you abandon the gas giant colony, unless you specifically demolish it.
    The gas giant settlement platform does not allow you to settle gas giants outside your normal range, for that you need a terraforming platform as well.
    Note: You have to have University at Level 19 or above to be able to settle a Gas Giant, regardless of wether you have a platform or ship.  The game will not even allow you to launch a Colony Ship to a Gas Giant until you have reached the required University level.  However it is possible for a player with a lower University level to take control of a Gas Giant from another player via the Insurrection spy mission.  All existing Gas Giant Settlement Platforms in such a situation will continue to work however new platforms will not be able to be built until the player obtains the appropriate University Level.
    Each level of platform provides one usable plot on the target planet.
    A Gas Giant Platform can not be demolished or downgraded if, by doing so, it would cause the number of plots available on your colony to go negative.
    You may send as many platforms as you like to a target planet.
    Other players (or your other colonies) can send platforms to your planets to assist your growth.
    Like glyph buildings, while platforms take up a location on the surface, they do not take up a usable plot. Unlike glyph buildings, platforms may be upgraded with resources once deployed.  They start the level of the lab that built the platform ship plus one.
    Warnings about Initial Build
    The initial build time for a Gas Giant Settlement Platform may take days.
    The build time that is shown on the plan is the actual build time based on the level of the lab on the planet that launched the platform ship plus one.
    You cannot demolish a Gas Giant Settlement Platform during its initial build.
    The plot count for a gas giant always starts at -1 because there must be a Planetary Command Center and the Gas Giant Settlement Platform, which is required to provide plots, hasn't been built yet. While demolishing the GGSP doesn't cause the plot count to go negative (since the GGSP itself doesn't take up a plot) it prevents the plot count from getting out of the negative.
    How to Use a Settlement Platform
    You can send a colony ship or platform first. The colony ship (or stake) reserves the planet, where the platform does not. Once you have the Gas Giant Settlement Ship built you can go to the star map and send it to a Gas Giant you would like to colonize.  One it arrives it will disapear from your SpacePort.  After you send a Colony Ship and the Gas Giant Settlement Platform, the platform will appear in Planetary Command Center (PCC) under Plans.
    A high level Gas Giant Lab can leave you waiting a day or more if the level is high enough.  In addition the Gas Giant Settlement Platform does produce a fair amount of trash at higher levels so you will need to plan accordingly.  Building a set of glyph buildings is generally a smart idea as it will give you something you can work with that will not be detrimental to you colony.  Building a Spaceport and having a scow on the planet can also work for some short term trash management.
    Also add some buildings to generate happiness.  Kalavian Ruins will give you about 5000 per hour happiness to begin with to counteract the trash.
    Glyph Recipie
    As an alternative to building a Gas Giant Settlement Ship at the shipyard, you can create a level one platform by combining sulfur, methane, galena, and anthracite glyphs at the Archaeology Ministry.

Gratch's Gauntlet:
  description: |-
    Thought to be one way the Great Race protected themselves from enemy agents.
    Slows down infiltration time by 1 hour plus 3 hours per level of the gauntlet. While spies are mired and spending time trying to find their way through the gauntlet, they cannot attack and are vulnerable to security sweeps. Because spies from allies don't "infiltrate", they are immune to Gratch's Gauntlet. A 0% efficiency Gratch's Guantlet still adds the 1 hour to the 'standard' infiltration time of one hour, for a total infiltration time of 2 hours.
    The actual practical usefullness of this glyph building is often highly debated.  Most arguements revolve around the fact that this building does not actualy catch incoming spies and just slows them down.  Still the player is actually required to run security sweeps to catch mirred down spies.  Othere debates tend to center around what level to build it to whether level 8 is suffiecent to keep spies mirred down for 24 hours, or to keep them mirred down for a full 90 hours.
    Note: previously this building was in-effective, but since the zero-travel-time spy bug has been fixed Gratch's Gauntlet should now work correctly.
    You can build this at the archaeology ministry by combining chromite, bauxite, gold, and kerogen glyphs.

Interdimensional Rift:
  description: |-
    Long ago the Great Race learned how to master the subspace. They used it for travel and communication, but also for more mundane purposes, like storage. If you are lucky enough to uncover one of the Great Race's storage rifts, many of your storage needs will be covered.
    The Interdimensional Rift (or IDR) provides storage for all 4 basic resources and for waste.  While the base storage amount is the same for all 5 resources, the exact amount of each resource stored does vary based on affinities.  The chart below will give you a basic idea of its capacity.  Like most other things in The Lacuna, the stroage capacity increases by 1.55 per level.
    Unlike the Ore Storage or Food Storage buildings do, Interdimensional Rift does not show the exact resources stored.  Neither does it allow you to dump resources.  Also it cannot reserve a specific resource from use like the Distribution Center does.
    Storage Amounts by level:
    (Numbers rounded off a little, figures shown are without boosts. Exact amounts depend on your affinities)
    Playing Tip: The Interdimensional Rift is the ultimate in high capacity storage and is highly favored for this by top players.  Sometimes is it used to replace all other storage on a planet.  If the Interdimensional Rift is of a high level it can make recovery from a heavy Snark assault very easy since it costs nothing to repair and provides very high amounts of storage.  When combined with other high level resource producing buildings in can be used to make a colony nearly impervious to assault by ships because all glyph buildings are free to repair and produce large amounts of resources.  This building would provide all the storage needed to repair the standard buildings.  It is due to this very reason that the Saben are such a difficult AI to take down. *The Saben have been shrunk down into a pea in recent months. So, they are no longer a threat, even with glyph buildings.

  description: |-
    It's not only a beautiful addition to your planet surface, it's also a great source of clean water for your people.
    Though it forms naturally on some planets, you can build one in the Archaeology Ministry by combining a magnetite glyph with a halite glyph.
    At level 1 it provides 4000 water + 4% per Environmental affinity point. Upgrades via halls.
  produces:
    - water
  recipe:
    - magnetite
    - halite
  type: functional

Oracle of Anid:
  description: |-
    The all seeing eye of the Great Race, that allowed them to keep tabs on their enemies. It allows viewing of nearby star systems from a planet without the use of a probe, like a telescope.
    The range is 10 map units per level.
    You can build this in the Archaeology Ministry by combining these glyphs: gold, uraninite, bauxite, and goethite
  recipe:
    - gold
    - uraninite
    - bauxite
    - goethite
  type: functional

Pantheon of Hagness:
  description: |-
    Investigation said The Pantheon of Hagness was a temple, which can move through subspace to anywhere on a planet, for The Great Race to rest under special power, refill their backpacks and refine their exploration power on the planet.
    Today, the resource generating power is lost, but it has the ability to generate a field that alters space. Though it won't increase the size of the planet it is attached to, it can increase the number of plots available on the planet. One extra plot for every level of the Pantheon.
    Note: You will still need Gas Giant Platforms or Terraforming Platforms if you are on a gas giant or planet outside your orbit.
    The Pantheon of Hagness was left behind by the Great Race, and therefore cannot be built through the normal tech tree. However, using the Archaeology Ministry you can build one by combining gypsum, trona, beryl, and anthracite glyphs.
    Playing Note: This building is rarely upgraded beyond the low levels.  Most players consider the costs of upgrading this building not worth it when they can colonize Gas Giants instead.
  recipe:
    - gypsum
    - trona
    - beryl
    - anthracite

Patch of Sand:
  description: |-
    A sandy patch can be a nice way to decorate your planet surface. As of server 3.0400 generates a small amount of ore (whatever kind a mine on the planet produces), can be upgraded to increase this resource production.  You are allowed 9 of these buildings per planet.
    You'll get a free plan for this when your sixth friend accepts their invitation to the game using the in-game invitation system.
    Playing Tip: Unlike most other glyph buildings this building is upgradeable using regular resources.
    You can build this in the Archaeology Ministry by using a single Bauxite glyph.
  produces:
    - ore
  recipe:
    - bauxite
  type: decorative

Ravine:
  description: |-
    A ravine is formed during movements of the planet's plates. It is too hot down there so it can only act as a natural waste sequestration well, which can store up to 100,000 waste at its first level.
    You can build a ravine at the Archaeology Ministry by combining zircon, methane, galena, and fluorite glyphs.
  recipe:
    - zircon
    - methane
    - galena
    - fluorite
  type: functional

Rocky Outcropping:
  description: |-
    A hard sharp bed of rock pokes out through your planet's surface. As of server 3.0400 generates a small amount of ore (whatever kind a mine on the planet produces), but can not be upgraded.
    You'll get a free plan for this when your fourth friend accepts their invitation to the game using the in-game invitation system.
    The rocky outcropping can be constructed in the Archaeology Ministry using a trona glyph.
  produces:
    - ore
  recipe:
    - trona
  type: decorative

Temple of the Drajilites:
  description: |-
    It is said that the ancient Drajilite clerics could see the heavens above them through their rituals. Tablets found around the Expanse hint that if one were to uncover the ancient Temple of the Drajilites then one would possess their power.
    Rumor has it this building gives you the ability to scan a remote planet (as one would with a Scanner) without being detected.
    The scanning range of this building is limited to 10 distance units per level of the Temple. There is no timer or restriction on how long it takes or how many times you want to scan the planets in the system.
    You can build a temple by combining in the following order: kerogen, rutile, chromite, and chalcopyrite glyphs in the Archaeology Ministry.
  recipe:
    - kerogen
    - rutile
    - chromite
    - chalcopyrite

Terraforming Platform:
  description: |-
    The Terraforming Platform is deployed from a Terraforming Platform Ship.  Once deployed it allows you to inhabit planets that your species couldn't normally survive on.
    A Level 1 Terraforming Platform can be constructed in the Archaeology Ministry using methane, zircon, magnetite, and beryl glyphs.
  recipe:
    - methane
    - zircon
    - magnetite
    - beryl
  type: functional

Volcano:
  description: |-
    Volcanos naturally form on many planets. As they erupt they bring a steady source of ore from the planet's core up to the surface. The production of a Volcano can be boosted by an Ore Refinery.
    Volcanos can be constructed using glyphs. The sequence is: Magnetite, Uraninite
  produces:
    - ore
  recipe:
    - magnetite
    - uraninite
